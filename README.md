Comparison of Deep Learning Models for Stock price Prediction
Models were trained  and tested on the Apple Stock Price dataset available  on the Yahoo Finance website.
The models were downloaded using the yfinance library. Report.docx gives all the details and the results  of the project.
App.py gives a web app built using streamlit where one can enter the stock ticker and the predictions made by the model would be displayed on the web page.
